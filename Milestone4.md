# Milestone 4 Writeup

The changes we chose to implement were:
- add functionality to the map
- add confidence intervals to the time series plots
- make changes to age tab to compare 2 years at once

We felt that adding functionality to the map would be the most impactful change we could make at this stage of the process. Although we had limited time to implement changes for this Milestone, the map was very close to working, so we felt it was feasible to complete.

We added confidence intervals to the time series plot since this was something we had talked about implementing from the start, and it was a simple addition that was practical to add in the time given.

We changed the age tab to include stacked bars so that a comparison could be made from 2 different years. This allows the user to easily visualize the change in distribution among the age groups over the time period.

We felt these three changes would be most impactful for the user experience given the time allotted for changes.

Were we to implement this app again from scratch, we would have included a tab for exploring differences in cancer incidence by gender.

The greatest challenges we faced in creating the final product were getting the separate tabs to allow for different variable selections, and getting the map functionality working.
