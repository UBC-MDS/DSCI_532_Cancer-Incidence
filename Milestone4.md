# Milestone 4 Writeup

The changes we chose to implement were:
- add functionality to the map
- add confidence intervals to the time series plots
- make changes to age tab to compare 2 years at once

We felt that adding functionality to the map would be the most impactful change we could make at this stage of the process. Although we had limited time to implement changes for this Milestone, the map was very close to working.

We added confidence intervals to the time series plot since this was something we had talked about implementing from the start, and it was a simple addition that was practical to add in the time given.

We changed the age tab to include 2 plots so that a comparison could be made from 2 different years. This allows the user to easily visualize the change in distribution among the age groups over the time period.

We felt these three changes would be most impactful for the user experience given the time allotted for changes.

Briefly discuss:

What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?
If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?
What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?
Here, we'll be grading your reasoning for the changes. Don't worry about "optimizing" your decision, we're just looking for sensibility here.
